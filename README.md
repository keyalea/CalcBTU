# CalcBTU

This is a simple Python program to calculate the total amount of BTUs needed to heat a home.  It asks for various user defined inputs and calculates a BTU value.

We needed a simple way to calculate BTUs in scenarios when certain values needed to be manually defined.  For example, if inputs were not given for type of insulation used, or if there wasn't any information supplied, we made assumptions, and calculated the value of the 2x4 and type of siding. It tended to take some time to do on a calculator, so I wrote  this program to simplify the process.

This should run on any machine that has Python installed.

I do have the following in my bash profile: alias python='python3'
