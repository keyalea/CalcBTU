# CalcBTU

This is a simple Python program to calculate the total amount of BTUs needed to heat a home.  It asks for various user defined inputs and calculates a BTU value.

We needed a simple way to calculate BTUs in scenarios when certain values needed to be manually defined, as opposed to placed into a fancy environmental program.  So for example, because inputs were not given for type of insulation used, or if there was none supplied, we assumed none, and instead calculated the value of the 2x4 and type of siding, then instead of figuring it out on a calculator, made this program to simplify the process.

This should run on any machine that has Python installed.  

I do have the following in my bash profile: alias python='python3' :-)
